#Machine Learning and DataFrame Operations

This repository demonstrates various tasks involving DataFrame operations and machine learning models using Python. The tasks include creating DataFrames, performing machine learning model implementations, applying transformations, and performing time series analysis. Below is an explanation of each task.

-> Table of Contents :

1.Create a DataFrame with 10 columns and 20 rows
     In this task, I created a pandas DataFrame with 10 columns and 20 rows containing random, but meaningful data.

2.Create a DataFrame from a JSON object with nested structures
    This task involves creating a pandas DataFrame from a JSON object with nested structures. I used a sample JSON object and normalized it to flatten 
    the nested structure.
    
3.Time Series Analysis with Pandas
    In this task, I performed time series analysis using pandas. This included resampling data, calculating rolling statistics, and performing lagging 
    operations.
    
4.Custom DataFrame Transformation using apply and groupby
    I created a custom transformation function that applies operations using apply() and groupby() to manipulate the DataFrame.
    
5.Machine Learning Models (Decision Tree & Random Forest)
    In this task, I applied Decision Tree and Random Forest models on the dataset from Kaggle (100_Sales Dataset) to predict sales and achieved good 
    accuracy.

#Conclusion:    
    This repository demonstrates various tasks using pandas for DataFrame manipulation, time series analysis, custom transformations, and applying machine learning models. Each task showcases the practical applications of data manipulation and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
